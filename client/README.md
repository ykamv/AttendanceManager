# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


Go to client folder and run npm install to install all the dependecies. Same with server folder

now go to client folder and run

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


now go to server folder and run npm start app.
Go to localhost:5000 to check if your server is connected or not.

I have used the following dependecies - 

Front Emd - "axios": "^0.25.0",
    "bootstrap": "^5.1.3",
    "mdb-react-ui-kit": "^2.3.0",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-bootstrap": "^2.1.2",

    "react-scripts": "5.0.0",
    "react-toastify": "^8.1.1",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
    
    
 Back End -

    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "express": "^4.17.2",
    "mysql2": "^2.3.3",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.15"
    
    
Due to some some bugs and problems I couldnt complete it on time I am still learning React and was having trouble with RestAPI and sending data over server, I will update the completed version soon!!
